# Description:

  A devo dating app, with the guided assistance of a Topher bot. Since most devos are afraid with interacting with real people, the matches will be between man and bot.


# Install Guide:
  At the top of this website, there should be a green "Code" button. Upon clicking it, navigate to the selection that says "HTTP". After navigating to your designated location in your local directory, run the following command:

```
git clone {http url}
```

In our case, simply running the following command given the correct rights to this project should suffice:

```
git clone https://github.com/urabidurr/ThePDFFiles__abidurr6_tahmimh2_marcoq4_tawabb.git
```
